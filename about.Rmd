This website is built in my intern in Wehi Medicine Institute, Melbourne University,08/2018, which is used for personal profile and notes for my science program in my academic career.

I was get admitted to Life science academy, Nanjing University in 09/2015 and about to finish this undergraduate project in 07/2019. After that, I will go for a phd program in Wehi soon (if every goes fine). I am pretty interested in computational sciencen and engineering, such as computaional Biology, chemistry or system biology. My work will be in both wet and dry lab, which is really awesome.
